# rpi-docker-gpsd-chrony

This Docker image facilitates the running of the Linux GPS daemon (gpsd) on a 
Raspberry Pi connected to an instance of Chrony. `gpsd` is a daemon 
that monitors one or more GPSes or AIS receivers attached to a host computer 
through serial or USB ports. `Chrony` is an NTP service.  

Together these services allow for a GPS 1PPS corrected timeserver.

## Prerequisites

- Raspberry Pi 4 with Docker installed.
    - tested on RPI 4 Model B (8GB RAM) 
    - tested on Debian 12 (Bookworm) with Kernal version 6.6.51+rpt-rpi-v8
    - tested on Docker version 27.5.1
- GPS module (timing model preferred)
    - tested on [Sparkfun Zed-9P](https://www.sparkfun.com/sparkfun-gps-rtk-sma-breakout-zed-f9p-qwiic.html)
- 5 wires needed – +VDC/RX/TX/GND/PPS

## Setup and Configuration Steps

### 1. Copy github project 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dkaulukukui/rpi-docker-gpsd-chrony
```

### 2. Setup Raspi GPIO
1. Enable the PPS dignal on Pin 18. In /boot/firmware/config.txt add the below to a new line.

    ```bash
    sudo bash -c "echo '# GPS PPS signals Information' >> /boot/firmware/config.txt"
    sudo bash -c "echo 'dtoverlay=pps-gpio,gpiopin=18' >> /boot/firmware/config.txt"
    ``` 

2. Enable UART and set the initial baud rate. 

    Note: Set baud rate for the specific GPS unit you have, if avaialble use the highest most frequently updated GPS output settings.  GPSD can parse most common GPS receiver outputs automatically and for the most part anything is better than the default 9600 NMEA.

    ```bash
    sudo bash -c "echo 'enable_uart=1' >> /boot/firmware/config.txt"
    sudo bash -c "echo 'init_uart_baud=38400' >> /boot/firmware/config.txt"
    ```

    The matching GPS speed will also need to be set on line 7 of [entrypoint.sh](./entrypoint.sh)

    ```bash
    GPS_SPEED="${GPS_SPEED:-38400}"
    ```


3. In /etc/modules, add ‘pps-gpio’ to a new line.

    ```bash 
    sudo bash -c "echo 'pps-gpio' >> /etc/modules"
    ```

4. Modify Device tree overlay to disable bluetooth

	```bash
	sudo bash -c "echo '# Disable Bluetooth' >> /boot/firmware/config.txt"
	sudo bash -c "echo 'dtoverlay=disable-bt' >> /boot/firmware/config.txt"
	```

    Disable the system service that initializes the BT

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl disable hciuart
    ```

5. Disable systemd-timesyncd service

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl stop systemd-timesyncd
    sudo systemctl disable systemd-timesyncd
    ```


### 4. Enable the serial hardware port

Run raspi-config -> 3 – Interface options -> I6 – Serial Port -> Would you like a login shell to be available over serial -> No. -> Would you like the serial port hardware to be enabled -> Yes.

Reboot -> Yes

### 4. Wire up the GPS module

Determine the voltage requirements of your GPS module first. 

Pin connections:

1. GPS PPS to RPi GPIO pin 12 (GPIO 18)
2. GPS VIN to RPi 5V pin 2 or 4 (or for 3.3V pin 1 or 17)
3. GPS GND to RPi GND pin 6,9,14,20,25,30,34 or 39
4. GPS RX to RPi UART TX pin 8 (GPIO14)
5. GPS TX to RPi UART RX pin 10 (GPIO15)

![RASPI PINOUT](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/images/GPIO-Pinout-Diagram-2.png?hash=df7d7847c57a1ca6d5b2617695de6d46)

### 5. Build Image

```bash
cd rpi-docker-gpsd-chrony
```

```bash
sudo docker build -t rpi-gpsd .
```

Alternatively a pre-built image (using 38400 baud) can be downloaded and installed from docker hub

```bash
sudo docker image pull dkaulukukui/rpi-docker-gpsd-chrony
```

### 6. Bring up the container

The command to bring up both containers (attached to the stdio terminal, useful for debugging) is:

```bash
cd rpi-docker-gpsd-chrony
```

```bash 
sudo docker compose up 
```

The command to bring up both containers in the background is:

```bash 
sudo docker compose up --detach
```

## Verficition steps

1. Ensure that the container starts up successfully

    Monitor docker console logs for any error messages.  Successful container start up should look similar to the below: 

<Insert Image of Console output showing successful container startup>


2. Check GPSD 

    - If opened as attached, open a new terminal window.
    
    - Attach container terminal 

        ```bash
        sudo docker exec -it gpsd bash
        ```

    - Verify PPS signal.

        ```bash
        sudo ppstest /dev/pps0 
        ```

        - Successful PPS connectivity should look like the below

            ```bash
            trying PPS source "/dev/pps0"
            found PPS source "/dev/pps0"
            ok, found 1 source(s), now start fetching data...
            source 0 - assert 1739485509.000083980, sequence: 100 - clear  0.000000000, sequence: 0
            source 0 - assert 1739485510.000083988, sequence: 101 - clear  0.000000000, sequence: 0
            source 0 - assert 1739485511.000083348, sequence: 102 - clear  0.000000000, sequence: 0
            source 0 - assert 1739485512.000086343, sequence: 103 - clear  0.000000000, sequence: 0
            ```

    - Verify GPS data

3. Check Chrony

    - Verify Chrony is seeing both the GPS and 1 PPS signals as valid and is using 1 PPS

        ```bash
        chronyc sources
        ```

        - Good Syncing with GPS and 1PPS 

        ```bash
        aa24e5ed30b7:/# chronyc sources
        MS Name/IP address         Stratum Poll Reach LastRx Last sample
        ===============================================================================

        ```


    - Verify that chrony is tracking and updating the system clock

        ```bash
        chronyc tracking
        ```

        - Good tracking data output

        ```bash
        aa24e5ed30b7:/# chronyc tracking

4. Verify System time

    ```bash
    date
    ```
			
## To do: 
- dial back docker --privlidged flag and make sure everything still works
- develop offset calculation and verification procedure to determine and quantify system timing accuracy
